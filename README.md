# Polka - the humane address book for the cloud

This is Polka, an experiment in handling data about people in the way how
people think about people, not in the way it's convenient for computers.

You can find more information about the concept behind Polka on the [Polka home
page](http://cornelius-schumacher.de/polka).

For information how to compile Polka see the `INSTALL.md` file.

If you have questions or comments please don't hesitate to contact Cornelius
Schumacher <schumacher@kde.org>.
