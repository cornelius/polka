* Common base class for IdentityGraphicsView and IdentityListView.

* More elegant way to handle fan menus, which doesn't require so many member
  variables and code, wich hardcodes the options.

* Maybe make menu disks grow bigger when menu is shown to prevent accidently
  hiding the menu again by hitting the space between menu elements.

* Migrate data between schema versions

* Group specific display names
